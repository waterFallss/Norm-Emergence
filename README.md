## Emergence of Multi-Step Conventions
Emergence of conventions and social norms has been an active area of research in multiagent systems to facilitate coordination
in agent societies. Various learning approaches, interaction frameworks,
topological connections, and information availability assumptions have
been investigated to facilitate the emergence of conventions. Most of
these scenarios involve repeated bilateral interactions between learning agents choosing actions simultaneously and often modeled as stage
games. Many real-life conventions, however, involve sequential decision
making by two or more parties. In this paper, we investigate convention
emergence in agent populations repeatedly playing bilateral sequential
games. We investigate the development of conventions for exchange of
greetings. We show what assumptions and biases can consistently produce stable and beneficial conventions to emerge in sequential interaction
scenarios. Our experimental results and concomitant analysis sheds light
on the dynamics of the emergence of multi-step conventions with sequential interactions.
